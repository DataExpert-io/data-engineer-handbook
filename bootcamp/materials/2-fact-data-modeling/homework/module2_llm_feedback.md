**This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM**

Hello,

I've reviewed your submission for the Fact Data Modeling assignment. Below are my comments and feedback for each of the areas you've tackled:

1. **De-duplication Query for `nba_game_details` (File: `1_game_details_query.sql`)**:

   - You have correctly used a `ROW_NUMBER()` approach to deduplicate entries based on `game_id`, `team_id`, and `player_id`.
   - The query is well-structured, and the logic flows correctly.
   - Consider commenting on why `ROW_NUMBER()` was chosen over other methods for deduplication.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL (File: `2_user_devices_cumulated_ddl.sql`)**:

   - The table schema correctly defines the columns and datatypes. Using `DATE[]` for `device_activity_datelist` is appropriate.
   - Including primary keys helps ensure data integrity, good job!

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation (File: `3_device_activity_datelist_query.sql`)**:

   - Your query to populate `user_devices_cumulated` is correctly structured for incremental updates.
   - The use of `FULL OUTER JOIN` allows for comprehensive data updates.
   - Good use of COALESCE to handle potential NULL values effectively.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist (File: `4_device_datelist_int_query.sql`)**:

   - This query demonstrates a solid understanding of transforming `dates_active` into an integer using a base-2 method.
   - Your selection of appropriately partitioned queries makes for a clear and concise solution.
   - Consider adding more detailed comments to explain the transformation logic for those who may not be familiar with bit manipulation.

5. **Hosts Activity Datelist DDL (File: `5_hosts_cumulated_ddl.sql`)**:

   - The schema is accurately defined with necessary fields and constraints, following requirements.
   - Good decision to include `PRIMARY KEY` constraint to manage uniqueness and prevent duplicates.

6. **Host Activity Datelist Implementation (File: `6_host_activity_datelist_query.sql`)**: 

   - The incremental update approach utilizing `FULL OUTER JOIN` is correctly implemented.
   - Your query seems comprehensive and effectively manages potential missing records for updated dates.

7. **Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation (File: `8_host_activity_reduced_query.sql`)**:

   - Your query is well-structured, with the use of `FULL OUTER JOIN` helping to account for new and existing data effectively.
   - The logic of manipulating arrays (`hit_array` and `unique_visitors_array`) is handled appropriately.
   - However, there's a small syntax error in the `ON CONFLICT` clause—a single `ON` is mistakenly repeated before `CONFLICT`.

8. **Reduced Host Fact Array DDL (File: `7_host_activity_reduced_ddl.sql`)**:

   - The schema is correctly set up with specified data types to match the requirements.
   - Good job including `PRIMARY KEY` constraints for the array fields.

Overall, you have done a commendable job implementing the queries and defining the schemas. The logic is consistent and follows best practices. It's evident that you’ve put effort into understanding and applying the correct methods for each task.

Here's your final grade:

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the good work and continue to refine your SQL practice! If you have any questions or need further clarification on my feedback, feel free to reach out.
