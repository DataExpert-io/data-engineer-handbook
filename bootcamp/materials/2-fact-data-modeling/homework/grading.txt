Thank you for your submission on Fact Data Modeling. I've reviewed each of the queries you provided. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. **De-duplication Query**:
   - The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` to remove duplicates based on `game_id`, `team_id`, and `player_id` is correct.
   - Comments are provided to give context, which is very helpful.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL**:
   - The schema for `user_devices_cumulated` is well-defined. Using `DATE[]` for `device_activity_datelist` adequately handles the requirement for an array of dates.
   - `PRIMARY KEY(user_id, date, browser_type)` is a reasonable choice for ensuring uniqueness.

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation**:
   - The incremental load from `web_events` and `devices` is well-thought-out.
   - There's a logical use of COALESCE to handle cases when there is no prior record, new record, or both.
   - The logic for `device_activity_datelist` and `date` calculations is sound, and the use of comments is appreciated for clarity.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist**:
   - Logical transformation of dates into base-2 integer representations is performed.
   - The use of bitwise operations to determine activity (monthly, weekly, and daily active) is correctly done.
   - Ensure constant strings for bitmasks are clearly explained as they might be a bit hard to digest for someone reading this for the first time.

5. **Host Activity Datelist DDL**:
   - The `hosts_cumulated` table is correctly structured with an array for `host_activity_datelist`.
   - The `PRIMARY KEY(host, date)` ensures uniqueness per host per date, aligning with requirements.

6. **Host Activity Datelist Implementation**:
   - Correct use of COALESCE and FULL OUTER JOIN to combine historical and new data about hosts.
   - Comment explanations clarify logic, aiding understanding.

7. **Reduced Host Fact Array DDL**:
   - The schema for `host_activity_reduced` appears correct, handling month aggregation with host data.
   - Including arrays for `hit_array` and `unique_visitors` allows for storing daily metrics which is efficient for the use case.

8. **Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation**:
   - The incremental process is correctly attempted with aggregation of daily site hits and unique visits.
   - The conflict resolution using `ON CONFLICT` ensures that data isn't overwritten, which is crucial for accumulation.
   - The approach in handling the mismatch of new and old data in arrays is very structured.

**General Feedback**:
- Overall, each query solution is marked by a clear structure and includes necessary comments explaining the logic, which is a great practice.
- The provided solutions are technically sound and align well with the requirements of Fact Data Modeling tasks.
- Ensure that SQL syntax follows consistent formatting and indentation for enhanced readability.

**FINAL GRADE**:
```json

  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
