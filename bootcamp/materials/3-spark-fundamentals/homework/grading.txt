** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Here is the feedback on your submission:

### Correctness
1. **Broadcast Join Configuration (Task 1):** 
   - You successfully disabled the automatic broadcast join by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to `-1`. This is correctly implemented.

2. **Explicit Broadcast Join (Task 2):**
   - You performed the broadcast join on `maps` table using the `broadcast` function, which is correctly implemented.
   - The join operations seem logical, although there may be a mismatch in column names; for instance, `mapid` vs. `map_id`. Please ensure the column names align with your dataset.

3. **Bucket Join (Task 3):**
   - You used the correct approach by creating bucketed tables on `match_id` with 16 buckets. However, using both `PARTITIONED BY` and `bucketBy` in the creation scripts is redundant. Only `bucketBy` should be used for creating bucketed tables.
   - Check the consistency of your column types and names with the actual dataset.

4. **Aggregate Queries (Task 4):**
   - You answered all required questions with SQL queries using the `bucket_result` view. The logic appears correct.
   - Ensure that `medal_id` in the Killing Spree medal query accurately reflects your dataset's ID for such medals (e.g., `2430242797`).

5. **Optimize Data Size (Task 5):**
   - You successfully used `sortWithinPartitions` and compared different combinations to determine the smallest data size.
   - The results are shown, which indicates a correct implementation of the task. The cardinality analysis is optional but helpful.

### Efficiency and Optimization
- You demonstrated understanding of optimization through bucket join and sorting within partitions. The choice to use low-cardinality columns for sorting is appropriate.

### Best Practices
- The use of views (e.g., `bucket_result`) and temporary tables is appropriate.
- Provision of queries and cardinality checks in comments is valuable for comprehension.

### Improvements
- Check for any mismatches in column names or types against your dataset.
- Remove redundant DDL specifications like `PARTITIONED BY` in bucketed tables.
- Ensure that file paths and dataset schema correspond accurately to your working environment.

### Final Comments
Your submission indicates a strong understanding of PySpark operations, including joins, aggregations, and performance optimization. You adhered to the tasks and demonstrated effective use of PySpark features.
