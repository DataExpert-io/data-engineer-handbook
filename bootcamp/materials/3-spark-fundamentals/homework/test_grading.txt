** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. Here’s the feedback on each component of the assignment:

### 1. Conversion to SparkSQL

You have successfully converted the SQL logic for deduplication and Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) into SparkSQL queries. 

**Backfill Query Conversion:**
   - Your SparkSQL query for deduplication using the window function is correctly implemented, using `ROW_NUMBER()` for managing duplicates. 
   - The SCD logic for actor transformation efficiently handles changes in the `quality_class` and `is_active` status, appropriately leveraging CTEs (`WITH` clauses) to organize intermediate steps.

### 2. PySpark Jobs

**PySpark Jobs:**

   - **Actors Job (`actor_films_job.py`):** The script reads actor and film data, processes them according to the specified requirements for SCD, and manages the logic of updating the actors' `quality_class` and `is_active` status. Your job aligns well with best practices. It captures all required logic, including aggregating frames and full outer joins for data combination.
   - **Dedupe Job (`dedupe_job.py`):** The deduplication logic using `ROW_NUMBER()` and filtering for the first occurrence of each record is well-implemented.

### 3. Tests

**Tests:**

   - **Actors Test (`test_actor_films_job.py`):** You’ve crafted a comprehensive test to validate the transformation logic. The test suitably employs mock data to verify that the transformation outputs match expectations, considering changes in ratings, films, and actor statuses.
   - **Dedupe Test (`test_dedupe_job.py`):** The test effectively verifies the deduplication logic, employing mock data to assert that duplicates are removed, maintaining only the first instance as expected.
   - Usage of `assert_df_equality()` is appropriate, and both transformations are validated correctly against expected outcomes. Your tests illustrate a strong understanding of data quality management principles.

### Areas for Improvement

- Ensure that your main functions in the PySpark jobs include input parameter documentation to enhance readability, especially if these jobs are to be further maintained or expanded by other engineers.
- Consider implementing additional error handling in your PySpark jobs to accommodate potential runtime issues, such as null values in critical columns or malformed data.

Overall, the submission demonstrates strong comprehension of PySpark, SparkSQL, and data quality testing methodologies. Your work is complete, efficient, and well-structured, reflecting adherence to best practices for data engineering projects.
