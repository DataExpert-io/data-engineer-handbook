### Feedback on Submission

**Flink Job Script (`assignment_job.py`):**

1. **Correctness:**
   - The Flink job appears to correctly sessionize web events based on IP address and host using a 5-minute gap, which is implemented using a session window. This adheres to the assignment requirements.
   - Writing the sessionized data to a PostgreSQL table is implemented correctly with the necessary JDBC connection setup.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - The script is well-structured with clear function delineation for setting up Kafka sources and PostgreSQL sinks.
   - Environment variables for Kafka and PostgreSQL parameters are used effectively, increasing the script's flexibility.
   - The session window and group-by logic are correctly applied to achieve sessionization.

3. **Testing Instructions:**
   - The script includes necessary elements for execution but lacks explicit testing instructions. It would benefit from a README file or comments that mention how to execute the script (e.g., run with specific environment variables set for Kafka and PostgreSQL).

4. **Documentation:**
   - Consider adding comments to clarify the logic, especially around the session window creation and the execution environment setup.

**SQL Script (`assignment_5.sql`):**

1. **Correctness:**
   - The SQL queries correctly aim to calculate the average number of web events per session for users on Tech Creator and compare results across different hosts.
  
2. **Code Quality:**
   - The SQL script is logically structured and utilizes aggregation functions correctly.
   - Usage of `LIKE '%techcreator%'` is appropriate, but be mindful of false positives with host names it might match.

3. **Testing Instructions:**
   - Similar to the Flink job script, instructions for executing these SQL queries in context would enhance usability. Indicating expected outputs or sample outputs could guide those running the query.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Including comments to describe each SQL query's objective could help future maintainers or users understand the purpose behind each.

### Summary

Your submission meets the basic requirements of the assignment, implementing the necessary functionality to sessionize data with a 5-minute gap and store it properly in PostgreSQL. Both the Flink job script and SQL queries are implemented accurately with good structure and logic. Minor improvements could include enhancing documentation for clarity and providing testing or execution instructions to assist users in running the scripts successfully.
