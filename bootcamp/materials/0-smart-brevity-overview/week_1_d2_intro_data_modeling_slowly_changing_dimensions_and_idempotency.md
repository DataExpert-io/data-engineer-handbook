      (Problems to Avoid)
        Insert without truncate
        Missing end date in queries
        Incomplete partition sensors
        Depends on past issues
        Latest partition dependency

        Same results regardless of

          How many times ran
          Time of day
      (Benefits)
        Reproducible results
        Easier troubleshooting
        Better unit testing
        Fewer silent failures
    )Slowly Changing Dimensions(
      (Definition)
        Attributes that change over time
        Examples
          Age
          Phone preferences
          Country
          Food preferences
      (Types)
        Type 0
          Static dimensions
          Never change
        Type 1
          Only latest value
          Not recommended for analytics
        Type 2
          Start and end dates
          Complete history
          Airbnb gold standard
        Type 3
          Original and current value
          Limited history
      (Implementation Methods)
        Full history processing
        Incremental loading
      (Modeling Approaches)
        Latest snapshot
          Not recommended
          Non-idempotent
        Daily snapshots
          Simple but storage heavy
          Max's preferred approach
        SCD modeling
          Compressed history
          Type 2 recommended
```


**Big picture:** Data pipelines must produce consistent results regardless of when or how many times they run. Slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) need careful modeling to maintain data accuracy over time.

**Idempotency essentials:**
- Pipelines should produce identical results whether run in production or backfill
- Multiple runs should not create duplicates
- Time windows must have clear boundaries
- All input dependencies must be verified

**Common idempotency pitfalls:**
- Using INSERT without TRUNCATE
- Unbounded date ranges
- Missing partition sensors
- Relying on latest data instead of point-in-time
- Cumulative dependencies on non-idempotent sources

**SCD modeling approaches:**
- Type 0: Fixed dimensions that never change
- Type 1: Latest value only (avoid for analytics)
- Type 2: Full history with start/end dates (recommended)
- Type 3: Original and current values only

**Best practices for Type 2 SCDs:**
- Use start and end dates for each value period
- Mark current records with future end date
- Can be loaded via full rebuild or incremental updates
- Choose implementation based on data volume and business needs

**Bottom line:** Idempotent pipelines and Type 2 SCDs are critical for reliable analytics, though implementation complexity should be balanced against business value and maintenance costs.

**Watch out for:** Using latest snapshot dimensions in analytical pipelines - this breaks idempotency and can cause incorrect historical analysis.
