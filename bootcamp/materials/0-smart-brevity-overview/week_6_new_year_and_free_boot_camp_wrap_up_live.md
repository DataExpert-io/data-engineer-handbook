**The big picture:** Zach Wilson discussed plans for his data engineering educational content in 2025, including boot camp updates, certification requirements, and future offerings.

**Free boot camp details:**
* Available until January 31st, 2025
* Full certification requires completing all assignments
* Videos will be removed from YouTube after deadline
* ~300 out of 30,000 registrants expected to complete certification
* Certified students receive 1-year paid newsletter subscription

**Paid boot camp highlights:**
* Starts January 6th, 2025
* 5-week intensive program, 15-20 hours/week
* Live sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 6-8pm PST
* Includes mentorship and capstone project
* Covers: Iceberg, Trino, Airflow, Spark, Snowflake, DBT
* Current 30% discount available (code: NEWYEAR30)

**Why it matters:** The paid program offers hands-on cloud experience, mentorship, and advanced technical content beyond the free boot camp's fundamentals.

**Key differences from free boot camp:**
* Cloud infrastructure provided
* Live instruction and mentorship
* Industry-standard tools and platforms
* Advanced technical content
* Real-world project experience

**Looking ahead:** 
* Plans for AI/ML integration content
* Potential new boot camps in Spring/Summer
* Focus on data engineering's evolution with AI
* Exploring university partnerships for formal degrees

**Bottom line:** The free boot camp served as an introduction, while the paid program offers deeper technical expertise and career advancement opportunities. Focus in 2025 will be on emerging technologies and advanced data engineering skills.
