# Managing Data Pipeline Maintenance and Technical Debt

```mermaid

```


**The big picture:** Data engineering maintenance is an inevitable and growing cost that requires strategic management to avoid burnout and ensure long-term sustainability.

**Key challenges:**

* Every pipeline adds maintenance cost over time
* 90%+ of data engineers report experiencing burnout
* On-call responsibilities and late-night fixes create stress
* Multiple stakeholders with urgent, competing priorities

**Smart strategies for managing maintenance:**

* On-call management:
  - Set clear SLAs (24 hours vs 4 hours)
  - Document every failure and bug
  - Create detailed runbooks for complex pipelines
  - Establish primary/secondary owners

* Technical debt reduction:
  - Dedicate time each quarter for cleanup (Tech Excellence Week)
  - Have on-call engineers address tech debt during rotation
  - Fix issues as you encounter them ("Boy Scout" approach)

* Pipeline optimization:
  - Delete unnecessary pipelines
  - Migrate to more efficient technologies
  - Implement sampling where appropriate
  - Use bucketing for large-scale joins

**Why it matters:** Without proper maintenance strategies, data teams face increasing technical debt, reliability issues, and eventual burnout.

**Best practices for runbooks:**

* List primary/secondary owners
* Document upstream and downstream dependencies
* Detail common issues and solutions
* Specify SLAs and agreements
* Include contact info for critical stakeholders

**Bottom line:** Success in data engineering requires balancing new development with sustainable maintenance practices. Focus on documentation, clear ownership models, and regular technical debt reduction to avoid getting crushed by maintenance costs over time.
