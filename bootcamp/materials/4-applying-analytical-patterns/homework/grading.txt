LLM Feedback

** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for submitting your SQL assignment. I've reviewed your queries against the tasks specified, and I'll provide feedback on each section. Let's examine your work and determine if it meets the requirements and is executed correctly.

### Task 1: Player State Tracking
- You define a custom enum type `player_state` and create a table `player_state_tracker` to track state changes.
- The logic in `load_data_for_years` function correctly assigns states based on player activity across seasons.
- You use a loop to handle multiple seasons, allowing for cumulative data loading and state decision-making.

*Comments:*
- This is a well-structured approach, demonstrating clean and orderly logic for tracking player states. However, providing a test sample in the comments would improve understanding of how it works in practice.

### Task 2: Use of `GROUPING SETS`
- Your query successfully aggregates game details using `GROUPING SETS` along the required dimensions (Player-Team, Player-Season, Team).
- You've broken down how each grouped data point could be used, with specific outputs for questions like who scored the most points for a single team, in one season, or which team has won the most games.

*Comments:*
- Efficient use of SQL aggregation functions. It's a bit verbose but comprehensively addresses the task requirements. Ensure to clarify the purpose of each subquery with comments for better readability.

### Task 3: Window Functions for Complex Analysis
- **For Task 3a**: You correctly calculate the most games a team has won in a 90-game stretch using a window function. Your partitioning and row specification are accurate.
- **For Task 3b**: You've effectively identified streaks where LeBron James scores over 10 points and segregated them using an advanced window function technique.

*Comments:*
- The window function approach is clean and concise. Great job using CASE statements to add logic directly into the windowed calculations.
- Remember to link all these computations back to more descriptive variables/names in comments so they are clearer.

*General Feedback:*
- Consider renaming some intermediate common table expressions (CTEs) to make their purpose more obvious at a quick glance.
- Clarify the commentary surrounding certain complex sections to aid understanding, particularly for anyone unfamiliar with the logic behind these tasks.

### Final Grade

In summary, your submission accurately follows the specification, and you demonstrate advanced SQL techniques through both aggregation and window functions. All key elements are covered, and your script aligns well with the assignment's goals. Overall, this is a strong submission.
