### 1. DDL for `actors` table

- You created custom types `films` and `quality_class`, which is a good practice for organizing related attributes and ensuring consistent values.
- You've set a composite primary key on `actor_id` and `current_year`, which makes sense if you envision multiple entries for each actor or multiple scenarios per year.

### 2. Cumulative table generation query

- The `WITH` clause to define `last_year` and `this_year` is well-organized.
- The cumulative update logic is correctly implemented, handling the combination of last year's and this year's data using `FULL JOIN` and `COALESCE`.
- The use of the `CASE` statement for assigning `quality_class` is a solid choice here, making it adaptable to rating thresholds.

### 3. DDL for `actors_history_scd` table

- The table design here is appropriate for maintaining temporal changes with `start_date` and `end_date`.
- The use of primary key on `(actor_id, start_date)` is a good choice for differentiating records based on change periods.

### 4. Backfill query for `actors_history_scd`

- You have effectively made use of multiple CTEs (`WITH` clauses) to backfill historical data by generating years, averaging ratings, and calculating change points.
- The logic to group data changes and maintain streaks with SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) is well implemented.
- The change flag mechanism and streak identification are clearly articulated.

### 5. Incremental query for `actors_history_scd`

- You've correctly introduced an `actor_scd_type` and used `UNNEST` for setting up and processing changes within columns as needed.
- The use of UNION ALL makes sense in this context to ensure complete data considering historical unchanged, changed, and new records.
- The check for changed records with `actor_scd_type` and the proficient handling of unchanged logic reflects good SQL practices.

### Overall Feedback

Your submission reflects a strong understanding of SQL, particularly with handling slowly changing dimensions, using CTEs for organized and readable queries, and managing complex table operations with DROP TYPE and CREATE operations. The script shows well-considered logic in maintaining historical actor data and updating them cumulatively and incrementally.

Your query is well-structured and functional as described in the problem brief. The approach and code readability are commendable.

### Recommendation

You should ensure that any dependencies or assumptions about tables like `actor_films` are documented for anyone else who might use the script. Always include comments to explain the purpose and logic of more complex sections of code, maintaining best practices for collaboration and future reference.
