**Feedback on SQL Submission for Dimensional Data Modeling - Week 1**

---

**Overview**

You have presented a comprehensive solution to the assignment by successfully tackling each of the specified tasks. Your submission includes the creation of tables and types, as well as the design and construction of queries that support both data backfilling and incremental updates for a slowly changing dimension (SCD) type 2 model.

**1. DDL for `actors` Table:** 

- You have created the `films` and `quality_class` structure as specified.
- Creation of a custom type `film_stats` and enum `quality_class` is correct and very useful for future queries.
- You clearly defined the `is_active` field, which is essential for identifying actors still working in the industry.

**Suggestions**: Ensure that data types like `FLOAT` in `film_stats` align with your data precision requirements. An appropriate decision on precision and scale can optimize storage and query performance.

**2. Cumulative Table Generation Query:**

- You correctly constructed a query that aggregates and inserts data into the `actors` table by building the film stats array and determining `quality_class`.
  
**Suggestions**: Consider breaking down complex CASE logic for `quality_class` assessments to improve readability. COMMENTS in SQL can provide clarity to future maintainers on the data choices made.

**3. DDL for `actors_history_scd` Table:**

- Your implementation of the type 2 SCD is solid and correct.

**Suggestions**: Ensure to document assumptions on why fields like `start_date` and `end_date` are integers. Are they timestamps by design or adherence to integer primary keys?

**4. Backfill Query for `actors_history_scd`:**

- The query effectively backfills the SCD table, correctly identifying change in `quality_class` and `is_active`.
- The use of LAG and partitions showcases competence in working with ordered window functions, demonstrating a good understanding of tracking changes over time.

**5. Incremental Query for `actors_history_scd`:**

- Your incremental query is well-structured and integrates last yearâ€™s data seamlessly, ensuring historical continuity.

**Suggestions**: Consider using explicit handling for data gaps to ensure no records are missed during transitions between years. Consider what logic would handle the presence of duplicate records or potential data anomalies during the join operations.

**Overall Evaluation**

Your solution demonstrates a high level of understanding of data modeling techniques and SQL functionalities. There is a clear structure to your approach which helps in both comprehension and practical application. You've comfortably addressed each of the assignment requirements with proficient use of SQL constructs relevant to dimensional data modeling.

**FINAL GRADE:**

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
``` 

Great job! Continue refining your query style and documentation practices for even greater efficiency and code readability.
