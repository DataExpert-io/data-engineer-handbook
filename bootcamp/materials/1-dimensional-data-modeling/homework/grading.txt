** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Dear Student,

Thank you for your submission. I have carefully reviewed the SQL scripts you provided for assignments 1 through 5. Below are my observations and feedback regarding each assignment:

### Assignment 1
- **Definition of Custom Types:** 
  - You have successfully created the custom types `film_struct` and `quality_class`. This setup appears correct and ready to be used in your tables.
  
- **Creation of Table `actors`:**
  - The use of the array of `film_struct` in the `films` column is very appropriate given the relational structure you want to achieve. Your table definition looks accurate.

### Assignment 2
- **Data Insertion with CTEs:**
  - The use of CTEs to organize data selection and transformation is commendable. It's clear that you've carefully structured your logic to handle year transitions and actor information updates.
  - **Case Logic:** The handling of `quality_class` based on `average_rating` is correct and coherent with logical expectations.
  - However, in the `INSERT INTO` statement, it's not intuitive on how you construct the statement since it's coupled within the CTE itself. The CTE seems correct, but it's a little hard to follow without explicit direct insertion/outside of WITH clause.

### Assignment 3
- **Table `actors_history_scd` Creation:**
  - Well-defined table with a composite primary key which ensures no duplicate records are inserted for a specific actor and start year.
  - This structure is appropriate for handling slow-changing dimensions (SCD).

### Assignment 4
- **Inserting Data into `actors_history_scd`:**
  - Smart use of window functions like `LAG` to track the previous state of actors.
  - The logic to compute `change_ind` and streak identifiers is solid and demonstrates a good understanding of updating records based on state changes.

### Assignment 5
- **Handling SCD in More Detail with CTEs:**
  - Youâ€™ve effectively utilized CTEs for logically organizing segments of SCD updates.
  - The correct separation and handling of unchanged, changed, historical, and new records show a complex and proficient approach to managing SCD updates.
  - The final selection combines all the logically separated parts correctly and appends the necessary `current_year`.

### General Comments
- **Code Organization:** You have organized your SQL code clearly, making good use of comments for explanations.
- **SQL Proficiency:** Your work reflects a strong understanding of SQL concepts, especially CTEs, window functions, and managing SCD.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Consider adding validations or exception handling to manage unforeseen issues during the execution, like duplicate keys or NULL entries where not expected.
- **Documentation:** While your SQL is well-commented, consider adding a high-level explanation of your approach at the top of each assignment for easier comprehension.

### Conclusion
Your submission successfully meets the requirements of the assignments. You have demonstrated a solid understanding of advanced SQL features and applied them effectively to create and manage database schema and SCD (slowly changing dimensions) processes.
