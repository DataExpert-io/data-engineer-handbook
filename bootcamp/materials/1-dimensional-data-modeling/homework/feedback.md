Thank you for the submission. 

Let's go through each of your tasks and analyze how well you've addressed the requirements.\

## Task 1: DDL for actors Table
- You've created a DDL for the actors table and associated data types as required in the assignment.
- You defined a complex type FILMS holding attributes like FILM, VOTES, RATING, FILMID, and YEAR, which correctly reflects the structure needed for the films column in the actors table.
- You created a type QUALITY_CLASS as ENUM. This is suitable for categorizing actors based on their performance.
The actors table's schema correctly includes the necessary columns, with PRIMARY KEY set to (ACTOR, CURRENT_YEAR) which aligns with the requirements.
- You used composite types appropriately within the actors table.
- Your DDL setup meets the assignment's requirements.

## Task 2: Cumulative Table Generation Query
- You have attempted to write a query to populate the actors table one year at a time.
- You utilized common table expressions (CTEs) to differentiate records by year.
- The SQL logic fills in missing information by joining tables (YESTERDAY and TODAY) and appropriately updates/sets values like QUALITY_CLASS, YEARS_SINCE_LAST_FILM, IS_ACTIVE, and CURRENT_YEAR.
- The complex use of CASE and COALESCE functions helps in adjusting values based on the conditions specified in the query.
- Your approach for populating the actors table appears correct. However, it seems like the SQL is slightly incomplete as you have a semicolon before selecting from YESTERDAY and TODAY. Ensure all conditions are explicitly handled. Currently, the lack of an INSERT statement in relation to the constructed SELECT statement in the cumulative table query might be an oversight.

## Task 3: DDL for actors_history_scd Table
You correctly defined a DDL for actors_history_scd and used type 2 dimension modeling principles:
The inclusion of START_YEAR and END_YEAR facilitates tracking overtime.
The composite primary key definition (ACTOR, END_YEAR, CURRENT_YEAR) is sufficient for identifying unique records in this context.
The setup reflects Type 2 SCD requirements accurately and supports tracking historical data with appropriate fields.
Well done on this task.

## Task 4: Backfill Query for actors_history_scd
You have a backfill query that consolidates historical changes:
You created a complex query setup to determine the differences across years using analytic functions LAG to track changes.
Proper CTE usage helps distinguish records such as unchanged trends, historical entries, and newly updated data.
Union operations create a comprehensive dataset merging both historical and current data changes together.
This taskâ€™s SQL logic appears comprehensive and aligns well with SCD methodologies.

## Task 5: Incremental Query for actors_history_scd
You have set up an incremental query that combines past data with new data:
The series of CTEs identifies changes in the actors' records year-wise, then performs unions to update records or add new records accordingly.
The use of analytic functions like LAG and window functions like SUM provides an effective way to manage change detection and ensure accurate historical tracking.
Your approach for the incremental SCD update works correctly as intended.

## Additional Comments
Make sure the cumulative query properly inserts into the target table, as missing INSERT INTO could lead to misinterpretations.
Always test queries for logical and syntactical correctness to ensure all paths in conditional logic are covered.
FINAL GRADE
{
"letter_grade": "B",
"passes": true
}
You have adequately addressed the main requirements specified in the assignment with only minor issues in the cumulative table generation query. Your work demonstrates a good understanding of dimensional modeling and SQL structuring.
