:pencil: **TL;DR**

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/edit/main/bootcamp/materials/1-dimensional-data-modeling/README.md).
2. [Start Postgres instance](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/edit/main/bootcamp/materials/1-dimensional-data-modeling/README.md#2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3run-postgres).
3. [Connect to Postgres](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/edit/main/bootcamp/materials/1-dimensional-data-modeling/README.md#threeconnect-to-postgres-in-database-client) using your preferred database management tool.

For detailed instructions and more information, please refer to the step-by-step instructions below.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Clone the repository**

- Clone the repo using the SSH link. This will create a new folder in the current directory on your local machine.
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook.git
    ```
    
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è To securely interact with GitHub repositories, it is recommended to use SSH keys. Follow the instructions provided **[here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)** to set up SSH keys on GitHub.
    > 

- Navigate into the cloned repo using the command line:
    
    ```bash
    cd data-engineer-handbook/bootcamp/materials/1-dimensional-data-modeling
    ```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Run Postgres**

There are two methods to get Postgres running locally.

### üíª¬†**Option 1: Run on local machine**

1. Install Postgres
    - For Mac: Follow this **[tutorial](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/installing-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew/)** (Homebrew is really nice for installing on Mac)
    - For Windows: Follow this **[tutorial](https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-windows/)**
2. Run this command after replacing **`<computer-username>`** with your computer's username:

    ```bash
    pg_restore -U <computer-username> -d postgres data.dump
    ```

    If you have any issue, the syntax is `pg_restore -U [username] -d [database_name] -h [host] -p [port] [backup_file]`
    
3. Set up DataGrip, DBeaver, or your VS Code extension to point at your locally running Postgres instance.
4. Have fun querying!

### üê≥ **Option 2: Run Postgres and PGAdmin in Docker**

- Install Docker Desktop from **[here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**.
- Copy **`example.env`** to **`.env`**:
    
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```

- Start the Docker Compose container:
    - If you're on Mac:
        
        ```bash
        make up
        ```
        
    - If you're on Windows:
        
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```
        
- A folder named **`postgres-data`** will be created in the root of the repo. The data backing your Postgres instance will be saved here.
- You can check that your Docker Compose stack is running by either:
    - Going into Docker Desktop: you should see an entry there with a drop-down for each of the containers running in your Docker Compose stack.
    - Running **`docker ps -a`** and looking for the containers with the name **`postgres`**.
- If you navigate to **`http://localhost:5050`** you will be able to see the PGAdmin instance up and running and should be able to connect to the following server as details shown:
    
    <img src=".attachments/pgadmin-server.png" style="width:500px;"/> 


- When you're finished with your Postgres instance(required in week 1 & 2 & 4), you can stop the Docker Compose containers with:
    
    ```bash
    docker compose stop
    ```

## :three:¬†**Connect to Postgres in Local Database Client**

- Some options for interacting with your Postgres instance:
    - DataGrip - JetBrains; 30-day free trial or paid version
    - VSCode built-in extension (there are a few of these).
    - PGAdmin.
    - Postbird.
    - Dbeaver
- Using your client of choice, follow the instructions to establish a new PostgreSQL connection.
    - The default username is **`postgres`** and corresponds to¬†**`$POSTGRES_USER`** in your¬†**`.env`**.
    - The default password is **`postgres`** and corresponds to¬†**`$POSTGRES_PASSWORD`** in your¬†**`.env`**.
    - The default database is **`postgres`** and corresponds to¬†**`$POSTGRES_DB`** in your¬†**`.env`**.
    - The default host is **`localhost`** or **`0.0.0.0`.** This is the IP address of the Docker container running the PostgreSQL instance.
    - The default port for Postgres is **`5432` .** This corresponds to the¬†**`$CONTAINER_PORT`**¬†variable in the¬†**`.env`** file.
    
    &rarr; :bulb: You can edit these values by modifying the corresponding values in **`.env`**.
    
- If the test connection is successful, click "Finish" or "Save" to save the connection. You should now be able to use the database client to manage your PostgreSQL database locally.

### :rotating_light:¬†**Need help loading tables?** :rotating_light:

> Refer to the instructions below to resolve the issue when the data dump fails to load tables, displaying the message `PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database; Skipping initialization.`
## **üö®¬†Tables not loading!? üö®**

- If the tables don't come with the loaded data, follow these steps with manual local installation of Postgres:

1. Find where your `psql` client is installed (Something like `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\runpsql.bat`)
2. Make sure you're in the root of the repo, and launch `psql` by running that `.bat` script
3. Enter your credentials for Postgres (described in the connect to Postgres section)
    - ‚Üí If the above worked, you should now be inside a psql REPL (It looks like `postgres=#`)
4. Run:
    
    ```bash
    postgres=# \\i data.dump
    ```
    
    - ‚Üí This will run the file `data.dump` from inside your psql REPL.

- If you did the setup using Option 2 which is Docker option, and the tables are not in the database, another solution is to: 

1. Find the container id by running `docker ps` - under CONTAINER ID
2. Go inside the container by executing `docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash`
3. Run `pg_restore -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/data.dump` 

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

1. **Not able to connect Postgres running on Docker?**
   - Please recheck details like host and port details.

2. **Throwing errors like connection refused even when all details are correct.**
   - Please check that the port(5432 or port you use) runs only docker service, not any other services.
     - Windows - use the command to check port availability in cmd ```netstat -ano | findstr :5432```
               - to kill rest of extra services use ```taskkill /PID <PID> /F```
     - Mac - use the command on terminal to check port availability ```lsof -i :5432```
           - to kill rest of extra services use ```kill -9 <PID>```
   

#### üí° Additional Docker Make commands

- To restart the Postgres instance, you can run **`make restart`**.
- To see logs from the Postgres container, run **`make logs`**.
- To inspect the Postgres container, run **`make inspect`**.
- To find the port Postgres is running on, run **`make ip`**.
