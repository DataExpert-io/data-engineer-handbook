Hello Team,

Thank you for your detailed submission. Let's dive into each aspect of your assignment:

### Ownership Assignments:
- The primary and secondary owners for each pipeline have been clearly assigned. It seems you have distributed these based on team member availability rather than specific expertise in business areas. Consider aligning owners with relevant expertise where possible for improved accountability and performance.

### On-call Schedule:
- The proposed on-call schedule is fair and provides flexibility for accommodating holidays. The system of swapping is practical and demonstrates consideration of workload and team member availability. However, it would be advantageous to include a detailed description of how a swap is formally communicated and approved, potentially in the runbooks.

### Runbook Details:
- Your runbooks cover the required elements: purpose, data processed, owners, common issues, and SLAs. Each pipeline includes data types and specific SLAs, which are clearly stated.
- The mention of common issues is valuable, particularly for those pipelines with no regular issues. For the issues that are mentioned, an explanatory note for terms such as "OOM issue from skew" or "perform salting" would benefit those unfamiliar with these terms.

### Clarity and Detail:
- The submission is well-structured in Markdown format with clear headings and descriptions, making it easy to read.
- However, consider increasing the granularity of ownership related to expertise and add more detailed descriptions of the potential issues to facilitate troubleshooting.

### Fairness and Feasibility:
- The on-call rotation is practical, showing fairness and thoughtfulness in accommodating human factors like holidays.

### Comprehensive Runbooks:
- The runbooks cover essentials and include SLAs, which is detailed and helpful for operational consistency.
- Realistic and relevant issues have been documented, which prepares the team for potential complications. While solutions are not required, providing strategy hints can be beneficial in some contexts, especially if terminologies are not universally known.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Align pipeline ownership with business expertise or interest when possible.
2. Include a communication protocol for swap agreements in the on-call schedule to ensure smooth operation.
3. Expand on technical terms and common issues for the benefit of all team members, even those less familiar with the specific domain.

Overall, your submission demonstrates a solid understanding of pipeline management responsibilities, and the content is clear and logically presented. Well done!
